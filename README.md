# Hydraulic-crane-arm-actuation-control
This project focused on understanding the role passive dynamics play in motion control applications for different actuation systems.
We specifically deal with the front arm cylinder of an electro-hydraulic crane model, where a mass spring damper mechanical system is dynamically modelled with the double acting front arm cylinder and a PID controller is designed and implemented to achieve three control tasks (force, position and hybrid control).Then, we add passive dynamics into this system and work on adjusting the compliance present due to passive dynamics to improve actuator performance for the control tasks. We also generate frequency reponse plots to analyze and identify best tunable stiffness values for force and position control.
